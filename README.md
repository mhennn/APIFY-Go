# APIFY 🚀

Apify allows you to deploy custom Python scripts built with FastAPI, instantly turning your specific JSON datasets into live APIs. This approach provides a flexible, serverless backend that accelerates prototyping by letting you define complex data structures and endpoints directly in code.

### AGIFY features
1. High-Performance Asynchronous Framework: Built for speed, handles requests efficiently, making it ideal for serving data quickly in a cloud environment.
2. You can easily integrate Apify's Dataset storage to save and retrieve your JSON dictionaries across different API requests.
3. Handles API requests quickly and efficiently.
4. Apify runs everything for you; you just focus on your code.
5. Automatically creates a web page to test your API.

### Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhennn/APIFY
```

### API Documentation
```bash

```

### Data Structural Application
1. Change your dataset
```bash
utils/data.py
```
2. Test the program
```bash
uvicorn apiFy:app --reload
```

### Getting of Data
```bash
def get_simple_data(self):
    self.all_data = self.data.simple_data()
    return self.all_data
```

### Ideal Usage
The program is design for simple dataset with no nested dict, but can be expanded.

### Testing the API
```bash
from request_module.request_params import RequestParam

def test():
    reqs = RequestParam("sample_dataset/data.csv")
    data = reqs.request_key_value("Name")
    print(data)

test()
```
